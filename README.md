# SamwiseOS v0.0.5: The Little OS That Could

### An AI-centric operating system built with relentless optimism and a whole lot of Python.

This project is a bold exploration into creating a unique, web-based operating system where the primary interface is a generative AI. After a successful and system-wide migration, our core logic now runs on a robust Python kernel, making the OS more powerful and extensible than ever. It's a testament to what we can achieve with a can-do attitude, a lot of heart, and a little help from our friends (even the digital ones!).

## What is this?

SamwiseOS is a web-based operating system designed from the ground up to be **AI-first**. Instead of a traditional GUI or a simple command line, you interact with the system through a conversation with an AI. The AI can understand complex commands, create and manage files, and even write and execute code on your behalf. The entire OS is a single-page application that runs right in your browser.

## The Hybrid Kernel: Our Superpower

SamwiseOS is a new genre of operating system: a **Hybrid Web OS**.

Our architecture is a deliberate fusion of two powerful environments. We combine a robust, sandboxed **Python kernel** running in WebAssembly with a nimble **JavaScript frontend** that has direct access to browser APIs. This isn't a compromise; it's our greatest strength.

- **The Python Kernel:** Handles the heavy lifting. All core logic for the virtual file system, user and group management, process control, and complex command execution lives here. It's secure, stateful, and the single source of truth for the OS.

- **The JavaScript Stage Manager:** Interacts with the world outside the sandbox. It handles everything that makes the OS feel alive and connected, including the terminal UI, sound synthesis, peer-to-peer networking, and graphical applications.


### How It Works: The `effect` Contract

The magic happens through a simple, powerful contract. When a command needs to interact with the browser, the Python kernel doesn't perform the action itself. Instead, it validates the request and returns a JSON object called an `effect`. For example, when you run `play C4 4n`, the Python kernel returns `{"effect": "play_sound", "notes": ["C4"], "duration": "4n"}`, and the JavaScript `CommandExecutor` plays the note. This keeps our core logic clean and secure within Python while leveraging the browser's full capabilities.

## Features

- **Brand New Onboarding!** A friendly, guided setup process to create your user account and secure the `root` password.

- **AI-Powered Shell:** Interact with the OS using natural language. The `gemini` command can use system tools to answer questions, and commands like `forge` and `storyboard` can generate and analyze code for you.

- **Complete Theming Engine & Cinematic Mode:** Customize the look and feel of the entire OS with the `theme` command. Change colors, fonts, and even system sounds! And for a little extra flair, toggle the `cinematic` mode for a dramatic, typewriter-style output.

- **Creative & Atmospheric Tools:** Unleash your creativity! We've added a suite of new commands for fun and immersion. Manage your tabletop RPG characters with the `character` command, roll dice with `roll`, and perform system rituals with `cast` and `ritual` to set the mood for your work.

- **Rich Command Set:** A huge list of POSIX-like commands, data processing utilities, and custom AI-powered tools.

- **GUI Applications:** Supports graphical applications like a text editor (`edit`), a file explorer, a paint program (`paint`), a BASIC interpreter (`basic`), a process viewer (`top`), and more!

- **Multi-User & Group Management:** A robust, secure system for managing users and groups (`useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd`), complete with `sudo` capabilities and a virtual `/etc/sudoers` file.

- **Advanced Permissions Model:** A Unix-like permission system (`chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`) that respects file ownership and group memberships.

- **Job Control & Process Management:** Run long-running tasks in the background (`&`), view them (`ps`, `jobs`), and manage them (`kill`, `fg`, `bg`).

- **Scripting Engine:** Write and execute shell scripts with the `run` command, complete with argument passing (`$1`, `$@`) and support for non-interactive password piping.

- **System Backup & Restore:** Create a full snapshot of your system (`backup`) and restore it later (`restore`), ensuring your data is always safe.

- **Persistent File System:** Your files are saved locally to your browser's IndexedDB.

- **Self-Contained & Offline-First:** No internet connection required after the initial setup!


## The Road Ahead: Our Next Five Parks

A vision without a plan is just a dream. Here is our official roadmap—a commitment to our users and a guide for our development.

### Milestone 1: The AI Town Manager 🧠

The AI is the heart of SamwiseOS. Our next priority is to make it a true partner in productivity.

- **Long-Term Memory:** Enable the AI to remember context across multiple sessions.

- **Advanced Tool Use:** Greatly expand the number of `effects` the AI can use, allowing it to perform more complex, multi-step tasks on its own.

- **Self-Correction:** Implement logic for the AI to analyze the output of commands it runs, recognize errors, and attempt to correct its own course of action.


### Milestone 2: The Creative Suite 🎨

An OS needs powerful, intuitive applications. We will expand our suite of GUI programs to empower human creativity.

- **`edit` v2.0:** Add syntax highlighting and collaborative multi-user editing.

- **`calc`:** A new grid-based spreadsheet application for calculations and data organization.

- **`slides`:** A new application for creating and presenting simple slideshows.


### Milestone 3: The Social Fabric 🤝

Leverage the browser's native networking capabilities to connect users in new ways.

- **Peer-to-Peer Filesystem:** Using **WebRTC**, allow users to securely and directly share files or entire directories with each other, right from the terminal.

- **`talk` command:** A simple, end-to-end encrypted chat client for real-time communication between SamwiseOS users.


### Milestone 4: The Hardware Bridge 🔌

The browser is our motherboard. It's time to plug things into it.

- **`joypad` API:** Integrate the **WebUSB/WebBluetooth** APIs to allow games and applications to respond to physical game controllers.

- **`g-paint`:** Create a new version of our `paint` application that uses **WebGPU** for hardware-accelerated graphics and effects.

- **`device-link`:** A command and API for interacting with microcontrollers and other USB-serial devices.


### Milestone 5: The Town Hall 🏛️

Focus on community, polish, and long-term sustainability.

- **Developer SDK:** Create clear, robust documentation and tooling to help third-party developers build and share their own commands and applications for SamwiseOS.

- **Accessibility Overhaul:** A top-to-bottom review to ensure the OS is usable and enjoyable for everyone.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository.**

2. **Download Pyodide** into the `dist/pyodide/` directory by following the instructions on their releases page and in the local `README.md`.

3. **Run a local web server** in the project's root directory (e.g., `python -m http.server`).

4. Open your browser and navigate to the server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
